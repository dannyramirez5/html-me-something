            So basically there's a narrative being propagated that COVID-19 (Coronavirus) is no more dangerous than
            Influenza
            (Flu) and should be treated as such. I'm hoping to get to the bottom of that using the data that's currently
            available.
            <br>
            I was hoping to use the most current data but unfortunately that isn't always available or complete. For
            this analysis I used 2018 Flu data as it was the latest year I could find with complete data.

                Deaths
            </h2>
            <p>
                When looking to compare the death toll for each virus I searched for data at the most granular,
                specifically when it came to time elapsed.
                At times I would find data that was aggregated by day (my ideal scenario) and other times it would be
                aggregated by month or 'period' (not ideal). I finally settled on two different data sets that were or
                could be grouped by week number. This is so comparing the two on a line graph would make more sense to
                the
                end user.

                <br>

                Kaggle.com is usually my go to for data sets and there I was able to find an up
                to date COVID-19 table. The <a href="https://github.com/imdevskp">author</a> scrapes, scrubs,
                cleanses and consolidates data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
                Engineering COVID-19 data sets. You've probably seen the online coronavirus dashboards that are based on
                their data. This table is updated daily and the information available is vast.

                    Data Set</a>
                <br>

                I was not able to find a good COVID data set on Kaggle so I turned to Google and found a table
                directly from the CDC. Unfortunately it is from 2018 but it's the latest I could find that had the
                necessary fields and time span.
