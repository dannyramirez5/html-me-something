            So basically there's a narrative being propagated that COVID-19 (Coronavirus) is no more dangerous than
            Influenza
            (Flu) and should be treated as such. I'm hoping to get to the bottom of that using the data that's currently
            available.
            <br>
            I was hoping to use the most current data but unfortunately that isn't always available or complete. For
            this analysis I used 2018 Flu data as it was the latest year I could find with complete data.

                Data Wrangling
            </h2>
            <p>
                When looking to compare the death toll for each virus I searched for data at the most granular,
                specifically when it came to time elapsed.
                At times I would find data that was aggregated by day (my ideal scenario) and other times it would be
                aggregated by month or 'period' (not ideal). I finally settled on two different data sets that were or
                could be grouped by week number. This is so comparing the two on a line graph would make more sense to
                the
                end user.

                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report">COVID-19 Data Set</a>
                <br>

                Kaggle.com is usually my go to for data sets and there I was able to find an up
                to date COVID-19 table. The <a href="https://github.com/imdevskp">author</a> scrapes, scrubs,
                cleanses and consolidates data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
                Engineering COVID-19 data sets. You've probably seen the online coronavirus dashboards that are based on
                their data. This table is updated daily and the information available is vast.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a
                    href="https://data.cdc.gov/Health-Statistics/Deaths-from-Pneumonia-and-Influenza-P-I-and-all-de/pp7x-dyj2">Influenza
                    Data Set</a>
                <br>

                I was not able to find a good COVID data set on Kaggle so I turned to Google and found a table
                directly from the CDC. Unfortunately it is from 2018 but it's the latest I could find that had the
                necessary fields and time span.
                Something to note about this data are how the death numbers are aggregated. The table has a column for
                flu deaths and a column for pneumonia deaths. The reason pneumonia deaths are in play is because of the
                close association pneumonia has with the flu. Although influenza can lead to bacterial pneumonia, it is
                not exclusively the reason a person can develop pneumonia. For this reason I cannot stand by these
                influenza related death numbers 100% as I know going in to the analysis that the numbers are skewed and
                much
                higher than what they actually are. In essence, take the flu numbers with a grain of salt and think of
                them as the absolute worst case scenario.

            <p>
                Again, I cant reiterate enough how the flu deaths are significantly higher than they really are and to
                take this total with a grain of salt.
                <br>
                Before I continue, I must explain what standard deviation is as not everyone is familiar with the
                concept.
